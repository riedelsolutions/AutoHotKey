# AutoHotKey
AutoHotKey scripts I've written to simplify tasks (mostly simple shortcuts).


[Audition](https://github.com/riedelsolutions/AutoHotKey/blob/master/audition.ahk)


Straightforward, extremely simple shortcut script for Audition to fix issue when certain XLRs record on only one channel.
Copies left channel to the right, not before deleting any mic noise from the right.


[Notion](https://github.com/riedelsolutions/AutoHotKey/blob/master/notion.ahk)


Shortcut to make a to-do list in a second. Creates a blank subheader with a '/' as a placeholder for the date + a to-do block, to start typing the important tasks right away.


[Containers](https://github.com/riedelsolutions/AutoHotKey/blob/master/containers.ahk)


Shortcut to my most used container in Firefox, to avoid the needlessly nested UI.
